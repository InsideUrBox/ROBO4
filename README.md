Feel free to add or work on anything that you want to.

I've started with adding simple colour recognition with python (mostly just code from [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-color-detection-in-real-time-using-python-opencv/)
but with some changes that are relevant to our project. 

As well as sourcing [this](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/shubhamsantosh99/face-tracker-using-opencv-and-arduino-55412e?ref=tag&ref_id=camera&offset=0)
for handling the arduino side of things.
